# Artificial-Neural-Networks-Behind-The-scenes-
Why this paper ? What is its added value? 
Admittedly there are too many scientific papers on artificial neural networks (you can search on the net, yourself, mainly if you're a data scientist or machine learning engineer: you have certainly read tons of papers on this). But imagine ! There are no papers which give examples of real "hand computation" of these fascinating algorithms (behind artificial neural networks).

In fact the advantage of this practical example, that I will present, is to show you  the "BEHIND THE SCENES" of theses algorithms, plunges you into the brains of those who built them, and then allows you to appropriate these algorithms (so, they will no longer be “black boxes”, just ready to use or build on them!):  
My ultimate goal is to be crystal clear and engaging, but with a touch of fun and uniqueness !
